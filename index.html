    <p>Ravana is a multi-headed demon king of the island of Lanka, and the chief antagonist in the Hindu epic Ramayana. In the Ramayana, Ravana is described as the eldest son of sage Vishrava and Kaikesi. He abducted Prince Rama's wife, Sita, and took her to his kingdom of Lanka, where he held her in the Ashoka Vatika. Rama, with the support of vanara King Sugriva and his army of vanaras, launched an invasion against Ravana in Lanka. Ravana was subsequently slain, and Rama rescued his beloved wife Sita.</p>

    <p>Ravana is widely portrayed as being an evil character, though he is also a learned scholar. He was well-versed in the six shastras and the four Vedas. Ravana is also considered to be the most revered devotee of Shiva. Images of Ravana are often seen associated with Shiva at temples. He also appears in the Buddhist Mahayana text Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra, in Buddhist Ramayanas and Jatakas, as well as in Jain Ramayanas. In some scriptures, he is depicted as one of Vishnu's cursed doorkeepers.</p>

    <p>Despite of being a demon he was massive devotee of mahakal. raavan was most intellectual person ever born in earth. had the power of control all over the world. made presioner all the planets for this son. he made a undestroyable empire for himself. he was fearles, unstopable. had the fire on his eyes. still people hate him but people forgot the shivji they do worsip he had given his mane R_A_A_V_A_N. even people forgtot he written shivtandav (most furious vers of shivji)</p>
